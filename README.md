Hi, my name is Claudio Cárcamo and I'm a Computer Engineering student on Chile.

I work mostly with C# on video games as a hobby and Data Science with Python as part of my studies, but I've also worked with many web development languages and tools.

I'm interested on web development, developing (and playing!) video games and data science.
